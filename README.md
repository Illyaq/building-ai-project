Final project for Building AI course
## Description
This project describes an AI-based system that helps users automatically detect spam emails and separate them from legitimate messages.

The goal of the system is to reduce unwanted emails and help users focus on important communication.

## How AI is used
The system uses machine learning techniques to analyze the content of emails.
It is trained on labeled data where emails are marked as spam or not spam.
Based on learned patterns such as words, phrases, and structure, the AI predicts whether a new email is spam.

## Data
The system requires labeled email data that includes the email text and a spam/not spam label.

## Benefits
- Saves time by reducing manual email sorting
- Decreases the amount of spam emails
- Helps users focus on important messages
- Can improve over time as more data becomes available
